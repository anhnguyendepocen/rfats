#PortfolioAnalytics

#https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PortfolioAnalytics/PortfolioAnalytics.pdf
#PortfolioAnalytics is an R package to provide numerical solutions for portfolio problems with complex constraints and objective sets. The goal of the package is to aid practicioners and researchers in solving portfolio optimization problems with complex constraints and objectives that mirror real-world applications.
#One of the goals of the packages is to provide a common interface to specify constraints and objectives that can be solved by any supported solver (i.e. optimization method). Currently supportedoptimization methods include
